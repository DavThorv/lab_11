# Lab 11: Segmentation

Welcome to lab 11!

In this lab we will experiment with real time image segmentation on image streams from a camera or a prerecorded video.

Start by cloning this repository on your machine.
You can also download the [videos](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/its/TEK5030/v19/resurser/lab_11_videos.zip) 
(259MB) and unzip them somewhere convenient on your computer. 
Then open the lab project in CLion.

The lab is carried out by following these steps:

  1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
  2. [Finish MultivariateNormalModel](lab-guide/2-finish-multivariate-normal-model.md)
  4. [Further work](lab-guide/3-further-work.md)
  
At an appropriate time, our [proposed solution](https://github.uio.no/tek5030/lab_11_solution) will be made available.

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
